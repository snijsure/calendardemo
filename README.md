- What is it?
  - Its an attempt to build calendar progam, with look-n-feel similar to Sunrise
    Calendar app.

- What this program does:
   - Establishes two RecyclerView, top recycler view is managed by grid view manager, it holds the calendar
     data.
   - Bottom recycler view is used to display appointment data.

- Issues
   - Code uses hardcoded string, dimensions.
   - Right now  add event doesn't really do anything.
